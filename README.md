## Business Overview

Our AI-powered recommendation system addresses the lack of tailored skincare solutions for individuals with melanin-rich skin. By leveraging two datasets on skin care products and products reviews by different users , our model delivers personalized skincare recommendations, achieving an accuracy of over 90% in predicting optimal products for various skin needs and on different budgets.

## Business Understanding

This project aims to develop a recommendation system using advanced AI techniques to cater specifically to Black womenâ€™s skincare needs. By integrating machine learning, content- based filtering, collaborative filtering, and sentiment analysis, the system will offer personalized skincare recommendations. Leveraging skin_tone (Author's skin tone (e.g. fair, tan, etc.) as a classification feature, we aim to distinguish and target products that align with melanin-rich skin concerns.

## Data Understanding

The dataset was collected via a Python scraper and contains:
- Product Information: Over 8,000 beauty products from the Sephora online store, including product and brand names, prices, ingredients, ratings, and various features. 
- User Reviews: Approximately 1 million reviews across over 2,000 products in the skincare category. These reviews include user appearances, skin types, and review ratings.

The key features include:
- Product Features: `product_id`, `product_name`, `brand_name`, `ingredients`, `rating`, `price_ksh`, `new`, `out_of_stock`, `highlights`. 
- Review Features: `author_id`, `rating`, `review_text`, `skin_type`, `skin_tone`, and
`helpfulness`.


### EDA

The distribution shows that products labeled for combination skin are the most common, followed by those for dry, normal, and then oily skin. This insight can guide product selection based on prevalent skin types and consumer demand within the Black women demographic.

The chart highlights skincare products tailored to the specific needs of melanated skin, focusing on hydration, hyperpigmentation, and sun protection. **Signature Moisturizer** leads with the highest recommendation count, emphasizing a strong demand for deep hydration. Products targeting dark spots, such as **Blue Algae Vitamin C Dark Spot Correcting Peel**, show the importance of tone-evening solutions, while sunscreens like **Mineral MatteSunscreen SPF 40 PA+++** address the need for effective sun protection without a white cast. This selection showcases a commitment to skincare that respects and meets the unique requirements of darker skin tones.

Lighter skin tones show a higher count of both in-stock and out-of-stock products. This contrasts with deep skin tones which have fewer options overall and lower in-stock counts. This discrepancy might indicate a supply gap for these deeper skin tones, which are more likely to face limited product availability.

Products targeting melanated skin tones receive fewer recommendations, suggesting that product options may not fully address the needs or preferences of these individuals.

The heatmap analysis of `skin_type` and `skin_tone_category` highlights important insights that align closely with our objective of providing tailored skincare recommendations for Black women. Our data reveals a concentration of products available for combination and dry skin types, particularly within lighter skin tones. However, there is a notable scarcity of options for deeper skin tones, suggesting that Black women may have fewer product options specifically suited to their needs. This gap underscores the limited market focus on skincare for melanin-rich skin concerns, such as hyperpigmentation, dryness, and sensitivity, which are often more pronounced in deeper skin tones.

These findings directly support our business problem: many existing recommendation systems fail to provide targeted solutions for Black women. The evident lack of specialized options for drier skin in deeper tones emphasizes an opportunity to develop and recommend products that address this unique need. By prioritizing these underserved areas, our recommendation system can significantly enhance satisfaction and efficacy for Black women seeking products that work for their melanin-rich skin.
